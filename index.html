			<p>I am a senior at University of California, Berkeley studying Cyber Policy in <a href="https://isf.ugis.berkeley.edu/">Interdisciplinary Studies</a>. I currently assist information privacy and policy research with <a href ="http://www.jenking.net/">Dr. Jen King</a> at the <a href= "https://hai.stanford.edu/">Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a>.</p>

			</p>Projects I’ve worked on include <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/blogs/CCPA%20comments%20October%2028%202020_corrected.pdf">dark patterns in ccpa privacy policies</a>, machine learning fairness case study with the CDC (in review), and <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/interactives/65092/map/index.html">mapping 5G geostrategic advantages</a> as a research intern with the Wilson Center. I have additionally spoken in tech policy webinars by New America and the UN Major Group for Children and Youth, and acted as Youth Representative to a UN Expert Group Meeting on Digital Technologies.  Prior to research, I interned with cybersecurity company Nozomi Network, the CA 2nd Congressional District Office, and the City of Oakland.</p>

			</p>In my last year at Cal I’m excited to co-teach a course on public service internships as a Director for Cal in the Capital. I will be graduating Spring 2021, an ACSA/CRA Women Studying Information Security Scholar, a Cal Leadership Award Scholar and a Haas Public Service Leader.</p>
